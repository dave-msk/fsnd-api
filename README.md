# Full Stack API Final Project

## Introduction

This repository contains project code for the [Full Stack API Final Project](https://github.com/udacity/FSND/tree/master/projects/02_trivia_api/starter) in the [Full Stack Web Developer](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0044) course offered by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/). This project is separated into its [frontend](./frontend) and [backend](backend) parts for a web application called **Trivia** described below. The respective descriptions for each part can be found in their corresponding README files.

## Full Stack Trivia

The **Trivia** application is responsible to manage a set of categorized questions with answers, which are to be played in a Q&A game. It consists of a backend service for an API server that supports a set of operations, with a frontend web application to perform the interations.

Udacity is invested in creating bonding experiences for its employees and students. A bunch of team members got the idea to hold trivia on a regular basis and created a webpage to manage the trivia app and play the game, but their API experience is limited and still needs to be built out. 

That where you come in! Help them finish the trivia app so they can start holding trivia and seeing who's the most knowledgeable of the bunch. The application must:

1) Display questions - both all questions and by category. Questions should show the question, category and difficulty rating by default and can show/hide the answer. 
2) Delete questions.
3) Add questions and require that they include question and answer text.
4) Search for questions based on a text query string.
5) Play the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category. 

Completing this trivia app will give you the ability to structure plan, implement, and test an API - skills essential for enabling your future applications to communicate with others.
